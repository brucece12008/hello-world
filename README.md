Bruce's 2020 Programming Projects 
I'm Bruce, an aspiring student of software programming. From an early age, I've always been fascinated by computers that's why I'm considering a career change to pursue my original passion.
This is the beginning of an interesting and eciting journey. I look forward to the challenges and learning opportunities that come with this journey.
